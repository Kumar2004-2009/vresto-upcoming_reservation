# ðŸ§¾ Upcoming Reservations â€“ Frontend Developer Challenge

A responsive React component that displays a list of upcoming reservations in a modern, pixel-perfect layout.

## ðŸŽ¯ Task Overview

The goal of this challenge is to provide users with a quick and intuitive way to review their upcoming reservations via a responsive UI component. The component is to be used within a user dashboard and supports core functionality such as:

- Displaying venue name, date, time, party size, and status.
- Allowing users to cancel reservations via a button (logs the reservation ID).
- Mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- Fully custom time picker with AM/PM toggling (no external UI libraries).
